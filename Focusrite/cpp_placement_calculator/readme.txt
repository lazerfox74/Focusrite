==== What I Did ====

For this project I broke the task up into specific steps.
I started by adding a while loop at the start of the tokenise function to iterate through and replace all instances of pi with "3.141"

from there I added the divide function by adding a divide enum, adding an if statement to check for the divisor operator and adding a divide case to the 
switch statement in the calculate funcion.

Finally I set the precision of the console out to 7 so the calculator would output the required number of decimal places.

=== Compile Instructions ===

If on Windows build using given solution,
If on Mac add the .cpp file to your own build.
